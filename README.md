## Handmade Hideaway

Great blog post on building a playground for kids. Broken into 4 parts and includes a full shopping list (cut lists, too). The only thing they didn't include were actual plans/blueprints, so I decided to learn Google SketchUp and match their blog posts making it easier for me to build for my own girls.
